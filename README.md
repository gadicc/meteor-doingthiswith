## TODO (depending on use)

* Author & App pages
* Various optimizations
* PubSubs (remove autopublish), infinite scroll
* More loginServices, author links (Meteor dev, twitter, gplus, etc)
* Graphs and top tags per category (tech, framework, app type)

* Snapshots of tag use every day, show on charts, identify trends
* Comments, voting, etc?  Can show e.g. top blog apps, etc.
* Could integrate usermap.meteor.com to show authors/apps on map.
